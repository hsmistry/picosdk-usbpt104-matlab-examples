# USB PT-104 Platinum Resistance Data Logger MATLAB Examples

*picosdk-usbpt104-matlab-examples* provides a MATLAB example demonstrating how to call shared library functions to acquire data from the USB PT-104 Platinum Resistance Data Logger.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

* [MATLAB](https://uk.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) for Microsoft Windows (32- or 64-bit) or Linux operating systems (64-bit).
* [PicoScope Support Toolbox](https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/53681-picoscope-support-toolbox)

**Notes:**

* MATLAB 2015b is recommended for 32-bit versions of MATLAB on Microsoft Windows operating systems.

### Installing the examples

We recommend using the [Add-Ons Explorer](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_env/get-add-ons.html) in MATLAB in order to install these files and obtain updates.

If your version of MATLAB does not have the Add-Ons Explorer, download the zip file from the [MATLAB Central File Exchange page](https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/64587-usb-pt-104-platinum-resistance-data-logger-matlab-examples)
 and add the root and sub-folders to the MATLAB path.

### Installing drivers

Drivers are available for the following platforms. Refer to the subsections below for further information.

#### Windows

* Download the PicoSDK (32-bit or 64-bit) driver package installer from our [Downloads page](https://www.picotech.com/downloads).

#### Linux

* Follow the instructions from our [Linux Software & Drivers for Oscilloscopes and Data Loggers page](https://www.picotech.com/downloads/linux) to install the required `libusbpt104` driver package.

### Programmer's Guides

You can download the Programmer's Guide providing a description of the API functions for the usbpt104 driver from our [website](https://www.picotech.com/library/documentation).
